#How to access
Describe the way how reviewers will access your artifacts:

#Clone a repository from GitHub, GitLab or any similar service
Download a package from a public website
Download a package from a private website (you will need to send information how to access your artifacts to AE chairs)
Access artifact via private machine with pre-installed software (only when access to rare or publicly unavailable hardware is required or proprietary software is used - you will need to send credentials to access your machine to the AE chairs)
Please describe approximate disk space required after unpacking your artifact.

#Hardware dependencies
Describe any specific hardware and specific features required to evaluate your artifact (vendor, CPU/GPU/FPGA, number of processors/cores, interconnect, memory, hardware counters, etc).

#Software dependencies
Describe any specific OS and software packages required to evaluate your artifact. This is particularly important if you share your source code and it must be compiled or if you rely on some proprietary software that you can not include to your package. In such case, we strongly suggest you to describe how to obtain and to install all third-party software, data sets and models.

Note that we are trying to obtain AE licenses for some commonly used proprietary tools and benchmarks - you will be informed in case of positive outcome.

#Data sets
If third-party data sets are not included in your packages (for example, they are very large or proprietary), please provide details about how to download and install them.

In case of proprietary data sets, we suggest you provide reviewers a public alternative subset for evaluation.

#Models
If third-party models are not included in your packages (for example, they are very large or proprietary), please provide details about how to download and install them.
